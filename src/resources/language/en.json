    "I am a software engineer who was born and raised in Vancouver, BC Canada. Most of my experience is with Javascript and React, but I am always looking to learn other frameworks and languages.",
    "Although I have not travelled much, I have greatly enjoyed travelling in the few times that I have went. My most recent trip to Taiwan was a bit of culture shock as it was my first time in Asia but I very much enjoyed experiencing Taiwanese culture and will definitely go again.",
    "In my spare time, I enjoy weightlifting, drawing and cooking new recipes for my family to try. Recently, I have taken up running as a result of the quarantine and have been enjoying it ever since!"
